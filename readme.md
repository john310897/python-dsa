# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Plan

## Introduction
This guide outlines a comprehensive plan to understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms. The goal is to build a strong foundation that will enable you to solve complex algorithmic problems effectively.

## Plan Overview
1. Understand the basics of each data structure.
2. Implement basic operations for each data structure.
3. Solve practice problems to solidify understanding.
4. Gradually move to more complex problems involving combinations of data structures and algorithms.
